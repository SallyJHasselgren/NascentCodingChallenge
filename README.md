Nascent coding challenge

Completed Instructions 1-4. 
Used an MUI library to help develop this web app.

All fields are required and have to be completed in order to submit the form. Once this button is pressed there will be validation of the email and phone number and if they are correct a modal will pop up telling the user to review their information. This modal also has a submit button and once this is pressed it clears the form and lets the user know it has been succesfully submitted.
